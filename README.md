# rectangles
This python code will generate number of rectangles from any given matrix.
## For example:

A 2x3 matrix \n

 1    1    1 
 
 1    1    1
 
Has 3 possible rectangles.

However, removing 1 point will change number of rectangles

## For example:

This 2x3 matrix

 1    0    1
 
 1    1    1
 
 Has 1 possible rectangle.
 
 Cheers!
